    </p>
    <p>You launch a game, play for a while, exit. Relaunch and... nothing was saved :(</p>
    <p>A problem might happened bc you&#39;re on windows and the game of yours handles unicode poorly (oh year 2023).
    </p>
    <p>To fix it, you need to recreate windows user from scratch with proper eNgLisH-onLY letters in it.
        Which is kinda lot just to play a game.</p>
    <h2 id="or-">Or...</h2>
    <p>You can debug the game a little!</p>
    <p>Our patient, when opened using ImHex (strings search) shows this:</p>
    <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brocbyte/brocbyte.github.io/main/img/unraveltwo_binary.png"
            alt="ImHex output"></p>
    <p>We&#39;ve got an &#39;LOCALAPPDATA&#39; entry here. It is a name of an environmental variable on Windows,
        pointing to
        personal user&#39;s folder.</p>
    <p>The thing is, when a program wants to save sth for a single user (like a game&#39;s progress), it often has to
        query
        the OS for some env variable, which points to an appropriate location.</p>
    <p>We cannot actually edit particularly &#39;LOCALAPPDATA&#39; one using standard &#39;Edit the system environment
        variables&#39; Windows&#39;s dialog, for some reason.</p>
    <h2 id="getting-to-know-each-other">Getting to know each other</h2>
    <p>So, what do we do? WinAPI provides several ways for quering environment variables:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><code>DWORD GetEnvironmentVariable(LPCTSTR lpName, LPTSTR lpBuffer, DWORD nSize);</code></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>LPCH GetEnvironmentStrings();</code></p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The first one returns the value of a particular variable, the second lists all of them.</p>
    <p>Our game has to use some of those to save our progress correctly.
        We will use <a href="http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor">http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor</a> to determine which
        one
        actually. It allows you to take a look into api-calls that a program is doing.</p>
    <p>For e.g. we will add both <code>GetEnvironmentVariable()</code> and <code>GetEnvironmentStrings()</code> for monitoring and then launch our
        program.
        In the output we don&#39;t see a single <code>GetEnvironmentVariable()</code> call with &#39;LOCALAPPDATA&#39; as an
        argument, so
        it gets all the information it needs by calling <code>GetEnvironmentStrings()</code>.
        If we were to enable C++RuntimeFunctions tracing too, we would actually see some &#39;strcmp&#39;-family
        functions
        being called on the returned value of <code>GetEnvironmentStrings()</code> :)</p>
    <p>We could modify the actual return value of this function somehow (dll injection?), but we&#39;re stupid and
        lazy...
    </p>
    <p>Or, we can go a much simpler way and just create our brand new own environment variable &#39;COCALAPPDATA&#39;!
        Naming is poor sry. Important: the length of the name must be kept the same.</p>
    <p>So we open our game.exe once again using ImHex. &#39;LOCALAPPDATA&#39; entry found previously can be easily
        patched
        to &#39;COCALAPPDATA&#39;, bc it lies in some .data region.</p>
    <p>Then we just set a new environment variable using standard windows dialog - and sheesh, saving system is working!
    </p>
    <h3 id="a-note">A note</h3>
    <p>The thing is, we didn&#39;t do anything hard at all and got the good result. Environment variables are cool!</p>
