    <h2 id="human-s-induction">Human&#39;s Induction</h2>
    <p>So, we&#39;ve got some Data, produced by some algorithm: [1, 3, 5, 7] - our observations of the real world.</p>
    <p>The question is: <em>what is the next number in a sequence? - what will happen in the future?</em></p>
    <p>Your perfectly balanced Occam’s Razor tells you: man it&#39;s just the list of odd numbers, go on, be sure!</p>
    <p>So, you type &#39;9&#39; in an Answer Box. Machine beeps &#39;yo dump ass&#39; and makes some Glados-like jokes.
        You
        failed.</p>
    <p>The underlying number generation program was kinda simple too: 2n − 1 + (n − 1)(n − 2)(n − 3)(n − 4).</p>
    <h2 id="what-to-do">What to do</h2>
    <p>You lost. Lost to the Machine. What&#39;ll u do about it?</p>
    <p>Ray Solomonoff has already come up with a solution for you: Solomonoff induction.</p>
    <p>Firstly we reformulate the problem statement slightly: you can&#39;t know 4 sure what&#39;s the real answer is,
        but u
        can get your <em>best guess</em>.</p>
    <p>Our final answer will consist of several hypotheses together with their probabilities of occurrence.</p>
    <p>For example, in our situation set of possible answers could look like that:</p>
    <pre><code>'<span class="hljs-built_in">odd</span> numbers'<span class="hljs-symbol">:</span> <span class="hljs-number">0.8</span>;

'<span class="hljs-number">2</span><span class="hljs-built_in">n</span> − <span class="hljs-number">1</span> + (<span class="hljs-built_in">n</span> − <span class="hljs-number">1</span>)(<span class="hljs-built_in">n</span> − <span class="hljs-number">2</span>)(<span class="hljs-built_in">n</span> − <span class="hljs-number">3</span>)(<span class="hljs-built_in">n</span> − <span class="hljs-number">4</span>)'<span class="hljs-symbol">:</span> <span class="hljs-number">0.05</span>;

... go on ...
</code></pre>
    <p>List of possible hypotheses is formed from the list of all possible turing machines: if a given turing machine
        halts
        with the desired output (1, 3, 5, 7), then it&#39;s interesting for us and we&#39;re happy to keep it.</p>
    <p>Each turing machine T with Data on its output tape is assigned with probability 1 / 2^(len(T)). That&#39;s the
        way of
        sticking to easier explanations (do not yet throw away your amazon-delivered Occam&#39;s Razor :)).</p>
    <h2 id="the-bad-news">The bad news</h2>
    <p>Of course this thing is incomputable, like most of the funny ones.
        You can&#39;t filter all turing machines by their output, the halting problem in its core.</p>
    <p>However, there are ways to approximate it. This way, approximate predictions of the future.</p>
