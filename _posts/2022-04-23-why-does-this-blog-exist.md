## Am i toxic enough to start my own blog?

Hello world!

This place was created primarily for my own mind-calmness and structurization.
Public visibility is obligatory by github rules and may actually come in handy: writing for others helps staying understandable and, hopefully, self-understandable.

There are going to be some error-prone texts about topics i find interesting: data-compression, algorithms, goedel-machines and so on.
