##### Working Experience
**Software Engineer - C++/Python/Typescript. [Ledas](https://ledas.com/) (2022 Jun - Now)**
- Project: [Client-server CAD application for orthodontics](https://ledas.com/en/expertise/3d-medical-software/)
    - Triangle mesh processing algorithms using OSS libraries (OpenMesh, Assimp, VTK, draco, three.js)
    - Computational geometry algorithms:
        - mesh-to-mesh distance calculation algorithm
        - editing distance between meshes
        - reusing BVH-instances between meshes
        - keypoint positioning for mesh segmentation
    - Built mesh-processing code (C++) into wasm modules to reuse on the client
- Project: Geometric constraint solver for orthodontics
    - Visualization techniques based on mapping 2D points into 3D
    - Mesh processing algorithms (mesh holes filling, computing normals)

**Intern - Coq/Isabelle-HOL. [A.P. Ershov IIS](https://www.iis.nsk.su/en) (2021 Autumn)**
- Project: Proving Algorithm Correctness of Java programs
